# FirstNonRepeatingElement
C# program for finding the first non-repeating element using XOR

Example: Given 1 1 2 2 3  [Array of 5 elements]

XOR of these elements will be 3
Hence, the first non-repeating element is 3

When there are multiple non-repeating elements, the first non-repeating element will be printed
